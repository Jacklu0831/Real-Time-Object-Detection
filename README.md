# Real-Time-Object-Detection

Drawing boxes on pictures and stuffs. Will use this for the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network model (SRGAN) to see how images/videos with higher resolution help with object detection. 

Below is my implementation of YOLOv3's sample output. Will work on writing README when I'm less busy.
